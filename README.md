## About  
This repository provides hands-on notebook-based implementations of popular boosting algorithms:  
- AdaBoost (classification & regression)  
- Gradient Boosting (classification & regression)  
- XGBoost (classification & regression)  

Each notebook walks through dataset loading, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The intent is to offer clear, educational and reusable code for anyone looking to understand or apply boosting models in their machine-learning workflows.

## What’s Inside  
The project folder contains the following notebooks:

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Adaboost Classification Implementation.ipynb` | Implementing AdaBoost for classification tasks. |
| `Adaboost Regression Implementation.ipynb`     | Implementing AdaBoost for regression tasks. |
| `GradientBoost Classification Implementation.ipynb` | Gradient Boosting classification workflow. |
| `Gradientboost Regression Implementation.ipynb`      | Gradient Boosting regression workflow. |
| `Xgboost Regression Implementation.ipynb`        | Regression using XGBoost algorithm. |
| `XgboostBoost Classification Implementation.ipynb` | Classification with XGBoost. |

## Getting Started  
To run and explore the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Boosting-Models.git
   cd Boosting-Models
```
2.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3.Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If there’s no requirements.txt yet, you can install typical dependencies such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn etc.

4.Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any of the notebooks listed above and follow along.

## Usage
- Open a notebook.
- Follow the step-by-step code, comments, and visualisations.
- Modify the dataset or algorithm parameters as desired.
- Use it as a template to embed boosting models into your own projects.

## Dependencies
Here’s a sample list of the Python packages used:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (aka sklearn)
- xgboost
- matplotlib / seaborn
- jupyter
(You may add exact versions once you finalise your requirements.txt.)

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! If you find bugs, want to add new boosting algorithm notebooks (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost), or improve documentation, please feel free to open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.
Here’s how you can contribute:
